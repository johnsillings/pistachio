================ TO-DO ================

STRIKE TODO
-----------
not all todo's get DONE
introduce a command to remove an item from the todo list WITHOUT adding it to the todayfile

PORT OVER YESTERDAY'S TODOS
---------------------------
for those todo's that didn't get finished yesterday... they should be on your radar for today
can think of two ways to do this
THE FIRST WAY:
	create a "yesterday todo file" that hangs out in setup
	on shutdown, copy/overwrite the yesterdaytodofile.txt with the contents of today's todofile
	on startup, copy/overwrite today's todofile with teh contents of the yesterdaytodofile.txt
	seems pretty simple and i think it would work fine
THE SECOND WAY:
	during the creation of a new todofile for today (if one doesn't already exist), look for the latest, non-today todofile (using their filenames which are all based on dates)
		using "last updated" could be problematic if somebody accesses an old todofile

ASCII ART ANIMATION
-------------------
ascii art animation for pistachio
source material? http://pistachio.ascii.uk/

GIT IGNORE
----------
git ignore the todo and stash directories for the development version of pistachio
git ignore the dev notes and dev scratchpad

HELP MENU
---------
add a help menu so new users can figure out what the available commands are

================ DONE ================

MARK TODOS AS DONE
------------------ 
"done [number]" feature that removes line from todofile and adds it to todayfile

	need a way to get the appropriate todofile line
		maybe something like 
	split, take out the first element of the array (e.g. "1:"), then rejoin
	then, open the todayfile (File.open) with the "a+" mode to append to the bottom

GIT PULL / PUSH
---------------
git pull functionality, similar to shutdown / git push functionality
